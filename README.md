```

## Scripts
The `scripts` folder holds the entry-points to the pipeline, using the logic defined in the `src` folder. Shell wrappers exist to run the pipeline for cluster/HPC.
```
└── script/
    ├── preprocess_methylation.py   # Preprocess methylation data
    ├── preprocess_wsi.py           # Preprocess WSI data
    ├── train_beta_vae.py           # Train β-VAE 
    ├── train_diffusion.py          # Train CDM
    ├── eval_beta_vae.py            # Evaluate β-VAE
    ├── eval_diffusion.py           # Evaluate CDM
```

## SRC
The `src` folder holds the core logic and main stateless implementation of the workflow. The functions defined are used in the `scripts` folder to run the full pipeline.
```
